I am a master's student of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. My research interests lie broadly in implementing and developing statistical methods to study scientific questions about genetics and genomics. I am also interested in nonparametric estimation, statistical learning, and bioinformatics. I believe my research is socially responsible for informing people of potential health risks and elevating their health condition in the long run.
